# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
I recently found out about the monty hall problem and i was intrigued by it. I felt like it doesnt make sense so i decided to write this program to simulate the problem and see if it makes sense.
This script runs the simulation 1 Milion times and calculates the probability of winning if you switch doors.
these were the results:
```
Wins: 1
Losses: 0
Win Percentage: 100%
Wins: 7
Losses: 3
Win Percentage: 70%
Wins: 68
Losses: 32
Win Percentage: 68%
Wins: 688
Losses: 312
Win Percentage: 68.8%
Wins: 6689
Losses: 3311
Win Percentage: 66.89%
Wins: 66620
Losses: 33380
Win Percentage: 66.62%
Wins: 666590
Losses: 333410
Win Percentage: 66.659%
```
From the data i can confirm that the probability of winning if you switch doors is 66.6% which is a significant increase from the 33.3% if you dont switch doors.
This means that the monty hall problem is correct and it is better to switch doors.
